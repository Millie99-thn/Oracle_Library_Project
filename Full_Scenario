# Oracle SQL Library Management System 📚

This project is a mini-library management system built with Oracle SQL. It demonstrates fundamental concepts of relational database design, constraints, sequences, triggers, and reporting views.

## 📌 Project Overview

The Library Management System manages:

- Authors and their books
- Library members
- Book loans and returns
- Views for reporting and summaries

The system includes logic for:
- Auto-incrementing primary keys via `SEQUENCE` and `TRIGGER`
- Referential integrity with `FOREIGN KEY` constraints
- Realistic sample data for testing

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Oracle Database** (Tested on Oracle 11g)
- SQL (DDL, DML, Views, Sequences, Triggers)

## 🧱 Database Structure

### Tables

| Table         | Description                          |
|---------------|--------------------------------------|
| `lib_authors` | Stores author details                |
| `lib_books`   | Stores book records                  |
| `lib_members` | Library members                      |
| `lib_loans`   | Book loans and return tracking       |

### Triggers

- Auto-populate primary keys on insert using sequences

### Views

| View Name                 | Description                                    |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `vw_books_with_authors`  | Lists all books with corresponding authors     |
| `vw_current_loans`       | Shows ongoing (unreturned) book loans          |
| `vw_books_borrow_count`  | Shows how many times each book was borrowed    |
| `vw_members_loan_summary`| Loan summary count per member                  |

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Run the full SQL script in your Oracle environment.
2. Explore the tables and views using `SELECT` queries.
3. Extend the system by adding procedures or UI connections.
